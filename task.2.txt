objects and its internal representation in Javascript...
-------------------------------------------------------

This represents and Object:

var car = {
     Modelname:"sedan",
     color:"red"
}

 in the above example car is the variable of the object.Inside the variable the the string BEFORE THE COLON is the "key" 
 and the content which comes AFTER THE COLON is the "value".
  *Key mostly can be a string or numbers for easy accessibility0.


 *Objects are important data types in javascript. 
 Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).

 *Primitive data types contain one value but
  Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 

 *These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties
  and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

 *It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. 

 *A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.
  A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object...
