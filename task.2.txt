objects and its internal representation in Javascript...
------------------------------------------------------

 *Objects are important data types in javascript. 
 Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).

 *Primitive data types contain one value but
  Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 

 *These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties
  and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

 *It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. 

 *A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.
  A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object...
