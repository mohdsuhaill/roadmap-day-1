 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 
 -----------------------------------
 
*HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that runs on top 
of the TCP/IP suite of protocols and defines how files are to be transferred 
between clients and servers on the world wide web.

* HTTP2: the concept of multiplexing that interleaves the requests and responses 
without head-of-line blocking and does so over a single TCP connection.

*It simplifies the protocol by removing some of the features that were present 
in HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, which can improve performance and reduce complexity..

*HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate.
 In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1....

*Launching of the HTTP/2 was an attempt to overcome the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and make it a more efficient web protocol.
 So, the major differences in these two are mainly the additions or upgrades applied in HTTP/2. Letâ€™s see what they are:

*Has more than one TCP(transmission Control Protocol),3-6 connection in later versions of it.
TCP is like a pipeline which will be created between the server and client(browser) to transfer request and responses.

*Has single TCP connections

*One connection per request.The next request slows down until the first response is sent....
Uses multiplexing which allows multiple request under single TCP...
